# Streaming Alert Website

## This site would need to be able to have clients login to the site using API from other websites.

Once on the site, clients are able to customize their donation page and have the ability to enable alert pop ups once a donation is received on said page.

The site would include it's own form of currency to be purchased by clients or their viewers.

The site would need to have a link generated specifically for each client's alerts/popups when they receive a donation.

The ability for the client to customize their alerts using HTML/CSS/JS is a must.

For an example of the site I'm looking for, please do a search for "Stream Alerts".

Practically looking for a clone of this but using different sites than they do.
